# Checkers

The checkerboard was designed to have a marble look and on the page their will be a message the displays who's turn it is.

Once a game is finished, no more moves will be allowed and a reset button will appear allowing for the players to hit it and restart the game.

This is a simple game of checkers that has the following rules implemented into it:


## Rules

Checkers is a board game played between two people on an 8x8 checked board like the one shown below.

Each player has 12 pieces, in this game we have marble pieces, that fit inside each of the boxes on the board.

The pieces are placed on every other dark square and then staggered by rows, like shown on the board.

Each Checkers player has different colored pieces (For this it is Black Marble and White Marble).

#### Taking A Turn

Whoever is the Black Marble will go first. 

Each player takes their turn by moving a piece and a message at the top will display who's turn it is after each move.

Pieces are always moved diagonally and can be moved in the following ways:

- Diagonally in the forward direction (towards the opponent) to the next dark square.
- If there is one of the opponent's pieces next to a piece and an empty space on the other side, you jump your opponent and the opponent piece will be sent to the captured area respectively. 
You can do multiple jumps if they are lined up in the forward direction. 

#### King's Pieces

The last row is called the king row. If you get a piece across the board to the opponent's king row, that piece becomes a king.

King pieces can move in both directions, forward and backward.

Once a piece is kinged, the player must wait until the next turn to jump out of the king row (Turn will automatically adjust).

#### Winning The Game

You win the game when the opponent has no more pieces and you captured all the opponenets pieces. 


## Checker Strategies

- Pieces on the sides are valuable because they can't be jumped.
- Don't bunch all your pieces in the middle or you may not be able to move, and then you will lose.
- Try to keep your pieces on the back row or king row for as long as possible, to keep the other player from gaining a king.
- Plan ahead and try to look at every possible move before you take your turn.

## Fun Facts

- The game of checkers is called "draughts" in many countries.
- It comes from an old game called Alquerque.
- Chess can be played on the same game board as checkers. (Also using similar code ;) )
- The game Chinese Checkers has very little to with Checkers and was invented by the Germans, not the Chinese.
- There are lots of different variants of checkers including a version that is played on a 10x10 board with 20 pieces per player.
